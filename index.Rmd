Welcome to my website! Here you will find a portfolio that describes the work I have done during my PhD. My research interests include Asset Pricing, Market Microstructure, Experimental Finance and Financial Econometrics. In my JMP, I apply machine learning methods to study the dynamics of expected equity returns.

I graduated with distinction from the [Vienna University of economics and Business](https://www.wu.ac.at/studium/master/quantitative-finance/overview/) in a two years MSc program in Quantitative Finance in 2016. Simultanously, I was working as researcher in the R&D department at the [Quantitative Asset Manager IQAM](https://www.iqam.com/). In November the same year, I began working toward my PhD in Finance at the [University of Luxembourg, LSF](https://wwwen.uni.lu/research/fdef/luxembourg_school_of_finance_research/people/gabriel_kaiser). I visited the [London School of Economics, LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/fmg/) as research fellow in the summer semester 2019. In 2020, I plan to attend the AEA Job Market, so please feel free to contact me anytime. Both CVs, academic and industry, can be downloaded here: [Academic CV](Academic_CV.pdf) and [Industry CV](CV_EN_A_Industry.pdf).
